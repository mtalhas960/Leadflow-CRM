| -------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |

## Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

**Examples:**

- `feat(leads): add bulk delete action`
- `fix(pipeline): resolve drag-drop state sync`
- `docs(readme): update installation steps`

## Code Style

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any` types
- **ESLint + Prettier** — run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before committing
- **Components** — PascalCase, one component per file
- **Hooks** — camelCase with `use` prefix
- **Server Components** by default — use `"use client"` only when needed

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `develop`
2. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build` — all must pass
3. Open a PR against `develop` (not `main`)
4. Fill out the PR template completely
5. Wait for review — at least 1 approval required before merge
6. Address review comments and push updates
7. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Reporting Issues

- Use the **Bug Report** template for bugs
- Use the **Feature Request** template for new ideas
- Search existing issues before creating a new one
- Include reproduction steps, screenshots, and environment details

## Development Workflow

```
main (stable releases)
  ↑
develop (integration branch)
  ↑
feature/*  fix/*  chore/*  (work branches)
```

1. All features branch from `develop`
2. PRs target `develop`
3. Releases merge `develop` → `main` with version tags
