## Why LeadFlow

Most CRMs lock you into monthly subscriptions, limit your data portability, and charge more as your team grows.

**LeadFlow is different:**

- **Self-hosted** - Deploy on your own infrastructure. Firebase Spark plan is free forever.
- **Open source (MIT)** - No hidden costs, no per-seat pricing, no surprises.
- **Your data stays yours** - No vendor lock-in. Export anytime.
- **Deploy anywhere** - Vercel, Node.js server, or your own infrastructure.
- **Under 10 minutes** - From clone to running.

## Free Tier Infrastructure (What This Runs On)

LeadFlow runs entirely on **free tiers** of best-in-class services. Your only cost is your domain.

| Service             | Free Tier Limit                                  | What It Powers              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Firebase Spark**  | 50k reads/day, 20k writes/day, 1GB storage       | Auth, database, storage     |
| **Vercel Hobby**    | 100GB bandwidth, 100k function invocations/month | Next.js deployment          |
| **Cloudinary Free** | 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth                     | File/image storage          |
| **Resend Free**     | 3,000 emails/month, 100/day                      | Transactional emails        |
| **Google APIs**     | Free within quota                                | Google Login, Calendar sync |
| **Sentry Free**     | 5k errors/month                                  | Error monitoring            |

These are the actual free-tier limits. A solo freelancer or small team will hit none of them in normal use. When you outgrow them, each service offers a cheap paid upgrade with no lock-in.

## Security

LeadFlow follows defense-in-depth security practices:

| Layer              | Protection                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Edge**           | Cloudflare WAF (OWASP Core Ruleset, rate limiting, bot management, DDoS protection)                                              |
| **Database**       | Firestore security rules with role-based -ss -`canWrite()`, `getWorkspaceRole()`, `canManageWorkspace()`, owner-only operations  |
| **Application**    | Server Action re-authorization, Admin SDK confined to API routes, `server-only` guards on data access, input validation with Zod |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth with optional MFA, custom password reset tokens (1hr expiry), rate-limited invite acceptance                       |
| **Audit**          | Full audit trail (who, what, when) on all mutations                                                                              |
